TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In this week, i learned how to use'def,return,if' in python. And i'd like to ask some questions about this lesson.
The first one is the differences between"[]"and"()". 
On the other hand, the exercise0 line16, "return (a_number) + 5", it also could be running for "return a_number + 5", so what is the mean of "()" in this code? 
In addtion, how many words should we writed on the'readme'? The debug console shows 'lab book entry completed',is it means the number of 'read me' words less than standard values?
