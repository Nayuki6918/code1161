TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In this week, i learned how to use'def,return,if' in python. And i'd like to ask some questions about this lesson.
The first one is the differences between"[]"and"()". 
On the other hand, the exercise0 line16, "return (a_number) + 5", it also could be running for "return a_number + 5", so what is the mean of "()" in this code?
