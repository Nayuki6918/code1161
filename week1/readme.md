TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In this tutorial, we learn about 2 different sortware, and started to install a text editor and use it to learn python. For the python, i have some questions about how to fix wrong text. In sometimes, the debug machine can find the wrong text and i need writed these text again(the same text),the debug machine shows that's right.
